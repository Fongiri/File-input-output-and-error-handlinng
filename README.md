# 🖋️ File Read & Write Challenge + 🧪 Error Handling Lab

Welcome to the **File Read & Write Challenge** combined with the **Error Handling Lab** – a hands-on Python project that strengthens your skills in file manipulation and error management.

## 📚 Description

This Python project is designed to:
- Prompt the user to enter a filename.
- Read and display the content from that file.
- Modify the content (e.g., convert all text to uppercase).
- Save the modified content into a new file called `output.txt`.
- Handle any errors that may occur during the process, such as missing files or permission issues.

It demonstrates best practices in Python file I/O and exception handling — key concepts for building strong and robust applications.

## 🎯 Outcomes

By completing this challenge, you will:
- Learn how to work with files in Python using `open()`, `readlines()`, and `writelines()`.
- Understand how to implement error handling using `try`, `except`, and `finally` blocks.
- Gain confidence in creating more reliable and user-friendly scripts.
- Be able to modify file contents based on your logic (e.g., uppercase, reverse, word count, etc.).

## 🛠️ Features

- Reads input from a user-specified file.
- Converts all lines to uppercase (modifiable logic).
- Writes to a new file: `output.txt`.
- Handles:
  - FileNotFoundError
  - PermissionError
  - Other unexpected exceptions
